    "t1 = \"In contrast to earlier views on BPD, this condition can remit, and symptoms can be reduced and managed. Nevertheless, specific symptoms such as fear of abandonment, impulsivity, intense anger, and an unstable self-image may persist. Individuals with BPD may also continue to experience impairments in social and occupational functioning and may have a need for ongoing treatment. Rates of suicide attempts and episodes of self-harm also decline over time, but they continue to occur more often than in individuals without BPD. Furthermore, in longitudinal studies, BPD is associated with increases in deaths due to suicide as well as with all-cause mortality. Thus, the lifetime burden and psychosocial impairment associated with BPD can be substantial because it typically has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood and can persist for many years. In addition, individuals with BPD experience increases in health care costs related to BPD and to other physical conditions.\"\n",
